## Strengths and weaknesses
- Sticks to one API style
- Pixel perfect UI disorder - unsupervised UI development is dangerous.
- Writes automated tests, trusts no one
- Not immune to overengineering but disciplined in prevention
- Smaller signed commits, frequent pushes - CI is cheaper than human labour
- Thinks in low-level, writes in high-level
- Mobile-first approach for UI design
- Automated dependency updates, no one is left behind
- Survived imposter syndrome twice
- Prefers cloud-agnostic, standardized, portable, Kubernetes-native tools instead of proprietary cloud offerings (but I don't host production databases in Kubernetes)
- Writes infrastructure which can be destroyed and recreated at any point in time
- Prefers local/remote dev containers instead of polluting the host machine

## Projects

### [system32](https://github.com/covik/system32)
A central hub for all my infrastructure needs.  
Hosts my Kubernetes cluster and deploys containerized applications.  
Manages DNS configuration and SSL certificates for multiple domains.  
Utilizes Pulumi TypeScript for a declarative Infrastructure-as-Code approach.  
CI pipeline validates and deploys changes on push to main, runs previews for pull requests.  
Codebase formatting and linting is enforced with Prettier and ESLint.

### [cinaries](https://github.com/covik/cinaries)
Short for container image binaries.  
When you build container images and pull other (public) software (mostly binaries, but not limited to them) using the `COPY` command,
you are actually downloading a lot more bytes than you need.  
The Cinaries project removes this problem.  
You get faster builds, smaller bills, and we all enjoy a minimal carbon footprint.  
The project is in its inception phase.

### [Bachelor's Thesis](https://github.com/covik/bachelors-thesis-document)
A smart box that opens only for students and logs activity to a web app. This project had practical applications at the faculty, such as allowing students to relax with a PlayStation in the faculty cafÃ© while safeguarding property (e.g., controllers). If controllers went missing, the last user would be held responsible.

I was responsible for wiring components like a relay, NFC reader, and electronic lock to an ESP32 board. The chip firmware can be found [here](https://github.com/covik/bachelors-thesis-firmware). The activity log application is a simple Laravel and Vue application deployed with Pulumi to a DigitalOcean managed Kubernetes cluster. The source code is available [here](https://github.com/covik/bachelors-thesis-web).

### [NetSchool](https://github.com/covik/netschool)
A Laravel application for exchanging materials between teachers and students. Developed as a final exam project in high school.

### [Scrollar](https://github.com/covik/scrollar)
A jQuery plugin for custom scrollbars, created for educational purposes.

### [iStunt UCP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwNK_paHqwU)
One of my very first web projects.  
It clearly demonstrates that I learned the fundamentals before diving into the library and framework ecosystem.  
I use it during job interviews to discuss what's wrong with the code.  
No matter where you pause, there's always room for improvement.
