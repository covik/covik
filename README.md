## About Me
Experienced web developer with a focus on full stack development (backend, frontend, and infrastructure). Passionate about understanding the entire development pipeline from commit to production. I prioritize thorough testing over minimal testing, though I occasionally go beyond and test aspects with marginal value.

## Projects
### [Scrollar](https://github.com/sudocovik/scrollar)
A jQuery plugin for custom scrollbars, created for educational purposes.

### [NetSchool](https://github.com/sudocovik/netschool)
A Laravel application for exchanging materials between teachers and students. Developed as a final exam project in high school.

### [Bachelor's Thesis](https://github.com/sudocovik/bachelors-thesis-document)
A smart box that opens only for students and logs activity to a web app. This project had practical applications at the faculty, such as allowing students to relax with a PlayStation in the faculty cafÃ© while safeguarding property (e.g., controllers). If controllers went missing, the last user would be held responsible.

I was responsible for wiring components like a relay, NFC reader, and electronic lock to an ESP32 board. The chip firmware can be found [here](https://github.com/sudocovik/bachelors-thesis-firmware). The activity log application is a simple Laravel and Vue application deployed with Pulumi to a DigitalOcean managed Kubernetes cluster. The source code is available [here](https://github.com/sudocovik/bachelors-thesis-web).

**//TODO:** Add a video showcase of the box features.
