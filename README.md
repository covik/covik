## Projects

### [system32](https://github.com/covik/system32)
A central hub for all my infrastructure needs.  
Hosts my Kubernetes cluster and manages DNS configurations for multiple domains.
Utilizes Pulumi TypeScript for a declarative Infrastructure-as-Code approach.

### [Scrollar](https://github.com/covik/scrollar)
A jQuery plugin for custom scrollbars, created for educational purposes.

### [NetSchool](https://github.com/covik/netschool)
A Laravel application for exchanging materials between teachers and students. Developed as a final exam project in high school.

### [Bachelor's Thesis](https://github.com/covik/bachelors-thesis-document)
A smart box that opens only for students and logs activity to a web app. This project had practical applications at the faculty, such as allowing students to relax with a PlayStation in the faculty cafÃ© while safeguarding property (e.g., controllers). If controllers went missing, the last user would be held responsible.

I was responsible for wiring components like a relay, NFC reader, and electronic lock to an ESP32 board. The chip firmware can be found [here](https://github.com/covik/bachelors-thesis-firmware). The activity log application is a simple Laravel and Vue application deployed with Pulumi to a DigitalOcean managed Kubernetes cluster. The source code is available [here](https://github.com/covik/bachelors-thesis-web).
