Dear Internet Archive Team,

When a donation redirected me to your job listings, I felt a real spark of excitement—“I could work on making the internet immutable!” I thought.

I’ve built immutable infrastructure for my own needs in the [covik/system32](https://github.com/covik/system32) project, prioritizing strong foundations before building on top. With a robust CI/CD pipeline, I can iterate quickly across backend and frontend projects.

My experience in infrastructure, backend, and frontend development is well-suited to your mission. I’m ready to dive into whatever area you need most, and I value real work over bureaucracy. I believe non-profits like yours appreciate that mindset even more than most for-profit companies.

I’d love to talk about how I can help your team continue preserving the internet for everyone.

Your  
Mate
